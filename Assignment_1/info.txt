In progress:
------

Completed:
----------
echo:
Notes- make sure you add the new commands to the main command logic otherwise it'll
just tell you that there is no command with that name 

batch mode: 
fixed infinite loop by making it check if fgets returns null. Made testBatch.txt to test different instructions.
Fixed the $ by using the isatty function (which checks which stream the program is recieving input from...) from the
unistd.h library. 

my_ls, my_mkdir, my_touch, my_cd:
all satisfy the criterias in instructions
Note - more general error handling?? not checking if dir already exists when using my_mkdir,
        not checking if file already exists, etc

one-liners:
Essentially works by usings strtok with delimeter ';' and feeds that into the interpreter instead
of the whole input at once. If more than 10 instructions are input it just ends after the 10th instruction
is completed. 

run:
run any shell command, it feeds whatever you give after run to your normal terminal and runs that!
no max number of arguments

test cases: 
wrote a script that basically just feeds the text files to the shell and outputs a .out file with result
and compares the to the _result.txt files. use reset.sh to reset the directories it makes. Did have an issue
with run where in batch mode it wouldn't print the banner until the end but I fixed it by using fflush(stdout);
(suggested by other people on ed as well). Everything runs on my terminal!
