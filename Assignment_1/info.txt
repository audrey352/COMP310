Due February 2nd

Works:
-----
1.2.1 echo ✓ 
1.2.2 batch mode ✓
1.2.3 my_ls, my_mkdir, my_touch, my_cd
1.2.4 One-liners

To do:
------
run


Completed:
----------
echo:
Notes- make sure you add the new commands to the main command logic otherwise it'll
just tell you that there is no command with that name 

batch mode: 
fixed infinite loop by making it check if fgets returns null. Made testBatch.txt to test different instructions.
Fixed the $ by using the isatty function (which checks which stream the program is recieving input from...) from the
unistd.h library. 

my_ls, my_mkdir, my_touch, my_cd:
all satisfy the criterias in instructions
Note - more general error handling?? not checking if dir already exists when using my_mkdir,
        not checking if file already exists, etc

one-liners:
Essentially works by usings strtok with delimeter ';' and feeds that into the interpreter instead
of the whole input at once. If more than 10 instructions are input it just ends after the 10th instruction
is completed. 

General notes:
RUN & WRITE CODE IN project/src, NOT in starter-code !!
