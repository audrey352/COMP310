Notes- make sure you add the new commands to the main command logic otherwise it'll
just tell you that there is no command with that name 
batch mode: 
fixed infinite loop by making it check if fgets returns null. Made testBatch.txt to test different instructions.
Fixed the $ by using the isatty function (which checks which stream the program is recieving input from...) from the
unistd.h library.
