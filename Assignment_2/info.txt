INFO & Notes:
Code Loading: Made an array in shellmemory with 1000 spots and wrote functions
add_line, get_line and load_program to add lines to the program memory, get lines 
from it and insert a whole program from a file. Not sure if we need an program_init
function but choose to leave it for now. I'm also not sure how to test this but
it compiles for now so I think it alright?

PCB: Just defined a struct that holds ints for PID, start index, program_length and 
program counter. I changed the load program function to return where it put it as 
its start instead of where it ends. I'm also not sure which program we're relying
on to know the program length and I think we may need to edit some of the code loading
functions in the future because maybe they should compute the length instead... and as of
right now it won't catch errors where the array runs out of memory (at least not gracefully).

New: 
- added an enqueue and dequeue functions to update the ready_queue. 
- updated source in interpreter.c to load script, create a pcb, add to ready queue, and run the whole queue
- moved pcb and ready_queue structs to .h

source cleanup: need to remove code lines from program_storage after the program is done running

Exec Command: Added exec command. A bit confused about the program behavior when there is only single process (for now I 
just have it call the source command but i don't really understand wether thats the correct behavior- the instructions 
say that it's not a special case so not sure what to do or what to implement). 
I had the different types of processes in a if statement chain so that we can choose behavior for each type of processing. 
I'm not sure if thats the correct implementation but I was very confused about the implementation they describe in instructions. 

Exec w/ Policies: implemented for everything except for the aging policy. The loop where 
it's supposed to go (RR) will have to change a bit. I'm implementing this by always dequeuing from the head of the queue,
and then there are different enqueue functions for different policies. This way we always have a sorted queue (which we need for aging I think).
One assumption I'm making right now is that there's only one exec running at once so no new programs get added after the first enqueue.
Also for SJF, if 2 programs have the same length when they get enqueued, I made the choice to add the most recent one after.

Other new changes:
- moved ready queue and pcb to readyqueue.c file
- load_program function now opens the script and checks if file exists + error if memory is too small
- created a pcb cleanup function to remove the program from storage  **dequeue is what disconnects pcb from ready queue
- added the prog1-2-3 files they give as examples in the src folder to test the policies easily

aging: instructions are kind of confusing, I think an intuitive way to think abt how the queue is updated is 
"initially order your queue in increasing score order, then run + keep head at the front as long as its score is lower or equal to the score
of the next pcb in the queue. When score of next pcb becomes lower, move head to tail of queue"
