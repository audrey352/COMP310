INFO & Notes:
Code Loading: Made an array in shellmemory with 1000 spots and wrote functions
add_line, get_line and load_program to add lines to the program memory, get lines 
from it and insert a whole program from a file. Not sure if we need an program_init
function but choose to leave it for now. I'm also not sure how to test this but
it compiles for now so I think it alright?

PCB: Just defined a struct that holds ints for PID, start index, program_length and 
program counter. I changed the load program function to return where it put it as 
its start instead of where it ends. I'm also not sure which program we're relying
on to know the program length and I think we may need to edit some of the code loading
functions in the future because maybe they should compute the length instead... and as of
right now it won't catch errors where the array runs out of memory (at least not gracefully).

New stuff: 
- added an enqueue and dequeue functions to update the ready_queue. 
- updated source in interpreter.c to load script, create a pcb, add to ready queue, and run the whole queue
- moved pcb and ready_queue structs to .h

source cleanup: need to remove code lines from program_storage after the program is done running

Note: I'm wondering if we should add these structs to their own .c/.h file to keep our code organized?
expecially if we need to write a bunch of helper functions to work with them
