INFO & Notes:
Code Loading: Made an array in shellmemory with 1000 spots and wrote functions
add_line, get_line and load_program to add lines to the program memory, get lines 
from it and insert a whole program from a file. Not sure if we need an program_init
function but choose to leave it for now. I'm also not sure how to test this but
it compiles for now so I think it alright?
